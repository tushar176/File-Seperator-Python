# File Seperator in Python
It is a script written in python which uses libraries like os,shutil.This script seperates different file types like audio,image,doc,
videos and moves the similiar file into a folder according to its file type .<br>

### For Example-<br>
moves all the image file into a single folder named image file and same for other file types.If there is no folder present than make 
the folder and if folder already exists then moves the files into it.If there is not a single image file present than this script will 
not make a folder of that and same for the other file types.<br>

I use this script to seperate the different file types which is being downloaded from the discord,whatsapp web,telegram.<br>
You can use this script accorrding to your requirments.<br>

Thank You..
